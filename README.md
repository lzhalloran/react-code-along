- Definite goals:
    - [x] deployment
    - [x] manage an API URL via global state
        - Ed Lesson : React Global State
    - [x] implement a form
    - [x] manage an API URL via global state AND via ENV variables
		- [x] improve our package.json command OR set up a .ENV file to use ENV variables
		- [x] improve our Netlify to use ENV variables 
	- [x] render data from global state 
		- [x] should update when global state updates
- Nice-to-haves:
    - [x] CSS framework (eg. React Bootstrap)
    - [ ] API that uses other HTTP verbs (eg. fetch with POST/PUT/DELETE)
